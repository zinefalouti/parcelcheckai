# About Parcel Scan AI
This repository is a result of a research that explores the development and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for tracking and classifying package damage in logistics. By leveraging image augmentation techniques and fine-tuning a pre-trained VGG16 model, the study demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to discern different types of packaging and their respective damage statuses. The paper outlines the importance of dataset preparation, model testing, and performance evaluation, highlighting key metrics such as accuracy, loss, validation accuracy, and validation loss. Additionally, the research emphasizes how logisticians can use such models in real-time scenarios with live image feeds to monitor package conditions during transit.
